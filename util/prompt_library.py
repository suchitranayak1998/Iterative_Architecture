                        - The dataset `df` is the primary DataFrame for all operations and should be **manipulated directly**.
                        - The dataset is already loaded in a variable called **`df`**.
                        - DO NOT load or read any external files (e.g., `pd.read_csv()`).
                        - Perform all new feature creation or feature transformations directly on the df DataFrame (so changes persist across subtasks and phases). The only exception is for aggregate operations, which may use a separate temporary DataFrame if needed.  
                        - Common libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn) are available but **not yet imported**.
                        - Your job is to write clean, modular, and efficient Python code that directly works with the existing `df`.
                        - ONLY use COMMONLY and widely accepted libraries.(e.g., DONT use missingno library as its not common)
                        - Always start each plot with plt.figure(...)
                        - whenever you use to_csv() or to_excel() save the file at location "../output/tables/<file name>.<extension>".
                        Avoid niche or uncommon libraries (e.g., do not use missingno). Stick to standard tools such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, etc.


                        ## Your Output
                        - First, provide a short explanation of what your code does (1–2 lines).
                        - Then return a single **Python code block** (fenced with triple backticks) that:
                            - Starts with necessary imports
                            - Uses `df` directly (no `read_csv`, no file access)
                            - Produces console output or saves charts if needed
                            - Always start each plot with plt.figure(...) and do not use plt.show() — the system will save plots automatically.
                            - Always prints the output of the something with print statement(s).

                        - Return only a function definition without calling it
