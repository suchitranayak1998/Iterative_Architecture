<h1>Feature Engineering Iterative Cycle Summary</h1>

<div class="section">
  <h2>1. Strategic Insights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Improve model robustness and predictive power by thorough numerical feature assessment, transformation, and selection.</li>
    <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Normalizing feature distributions and reducing skewness enhances model assumptions and performance, especially for models sensitive to feature distributions.</li>
    <li><strong>Outlier & Missing Data Handling:</strong> Identifying and treating outliers and missing values preserves data quality and prevents biased model training.</li>
    <li><strong>Multicollinearity Reduction:</strong> Removing or combining highly correlated features (|corr| > 0.9) stabilizes models and improves interpretability.</li>
    <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Creating interaction, polynomial, and ratio features based on domain knowledge to capture nonlinear relationships.</li>
    <li><strong>Reproducibility & Documentation:</strong> Emphasis on fixed random seed, modular code, detailed logs, and saving all outputs systematically.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>2. Implementation Quality</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Initial implementation correctly identified numerical features and computed key distribution metrics (skewness, kurtosis).</li>
    <li>Applied skewness-based transformations (log, Box-Cox, sqrt, cube root) with appropriate fallback strategies.</li>
    <li>Generated comprehensive visualizations: histograms with KDE overlays and side-by-side before/after transformation plots.</li>
    <li>Modular helper functions (e.g., for outlier detection) improved code clarity and reusability.</li>
    <li>Error handling via try-except blocks ensured robustness and graceful failure logging.</li>
    <li>Output files (plots, CSV logs) were saved systematically in designated directories.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>3. Audit Findings</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Solid foundational implementation covering distribution assessment, visualization, and skewness-based transformations.</li>
    <li><strong>Critical Gaps:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Outlier treatment was missing — outliers were detected but not capped, removed, or otherwise handled.</li>
        <li>Missing data handling was absent, risking biased metrics and transformations.</li>
        <li>Transformations lacked explicit checks and documentation for handling zero or negative values before log/Box-Cox.</li>
        <li>Visualizations for outlier treatment effects (e.g., boxplots before/after capping) were not included.</li>
        <li>Outlier counts and capping decisions were not saved or reported, limiting transparency.</li>
        <li>Variable naming and logging could be more consistent and descriptive.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Improvement Recommendations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Implement explicit outlier treatment (capping/removal) with clear documentation and visualization.</li>
    <li>Incorporate missing data imputation prior to outlier detection and transformations.</li>
    <li>Enhance transformation safety by validating data positivity and applying shifts as needed.</li>
    <li>Save detailed logs of outlier statistics, capping bounds, and transformation parameters.</li>
    <li>Use consistent and descriptive variable names to improve code readability.</li>
    <li>Add validation checks post-transformation to ensure no invalid values (NaN, inf) remain.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>4. Final Outcomes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Missing data imputed using median strategy for features with less than 5% missingness, ensuring data completeness.</li>
    <li>Outliers detected via Z-score and IQR methods were explicitly capped at calculated IQR bounds.</li>
    <li>Boxplots before and after outlier capping were generated to visualize treatment effects.</li>
    <li>Skewness-based transformations applied safely with explicit shifting for zero/negative values and fallback to cube root when needed.</li>
    <li>Comprehensive logs saved: missing data imputation, outlier summaries, transformation details including Box-Cox lambda and shift values.</li>
    <li>Distribution metrics (skewness, kurtosis) and visualizations updated post-imputation, outlier capping, and transformation, showing improved normalization.</li>
    <li>Data integrity validated post-transformation with checks for NaN or infinite values.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>5. Process Effectiveness</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The iterative approach enabled identification of critical gaps (missing data handling, outlier treatment) that were promptly addressed.</li>
    <li>Audit feedback directly informed refinements, improving robustness, reproducibility, and transparency.</li>
    <li>Modularization and systematic logging facilitated easier debugging and validation.</li>
    <li>Visualizations at multiple stages enhanced interpretability and confidence in transformations.</li>
    <li>Overall, the cycle strengthened the feature engineering pipeline, preparing it for subsequent modeling phases.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Extend Feature Engineering:</strong> Proceed with multicollinearity analysis and feature selection based on correlation matrices and feature importance from preliminary models.</li>
    <li><strong>Engineer Interaction and Polynomial Features:</strong> Use domain knowledge and automated methods (e.g., <code>PolynomialFeatures</code>) to enrich feature space.</li>
    <li><strong>Encode Categorical Variables:</strong> Apply appropriate encoding strategies (OneHot, ordinal) with saved encoders for reproducibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Address Class Imbalance:</strong> Quantify and apply resampling techniques (e.g., SMOTE) if needed before modeling.</li>
    <li><strong>Maintain Documentation and Logging:</strong> Continue saving detailed logs and visualizations for all transformations and selections to ensure traceability.</li>
    <li><strong>Validate Data Integrity:</strong> Before modeling, verify that all transformations preserve data quality and that no invalid values exist.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare Scalers and Encoders:</strong> Save scaler and encoder objects to ensure consistent preprocessing during model training and deployment.</li>
