subtask,process_type,status,reason,phase
Data Overview and Summary Statistics,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation provides summary statistics for numerical features using df.describe() and includes a summary for the categorical feature 'Class' by reporting unique values and value counts. This aligns well with the subtask objective of providing a data overview and summary statistics during EDA. The code performs relevant logic without shortcuts or obvious issues, and the output matches expected results.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Missing Values and Data Types Check,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The code correctly checks for missing values per column and prints the counts, fulfilling the missing values check. It also prints the data types of each column, addressing the data types verification. The output aligns with expected results, showing zero missing values and data types. There are no obvious issues or shortcuts in the implementation.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution Analysis of Numerical Features,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation correctly selects numerical features, computes skewness and kurtosis for each, and outputs the results, which aligns well with the subtask objective of distribution analysis. The code uses appropriate libraries and methods without shortcuts or errors, and the output values appear reasonable for typical numerical data distributions.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Correlation Analysis Among Features,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The code correctly selects numerical features, computes their correlation matrix, and outputs it, fulfilling the subtask objective of correlation analysis among features. The logic is appropriate and the printed matrix aligns with expected results. No obvious issues or shortcuts are present.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Class Distribution Analysis,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The code correctly counts the instances per class using value_counts(), prints the distribution, and plots it using seaborn barplot (as indicated). The output shows class counts consistent with the data, fulfilling the subtask objective of class distribution analysis during EDA. There are no obvious issues or shortcuts in the implementation.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Outlier Detection in Numerical Features,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation correctly focuses on numerical features for outlier detection using both IQR and Z-score methods, which are standard approaches in EDA. The output summary includes counts and percentages of outliers detected by each method, as well as statistics before and after removing outliers, demonstrating relevant and comprehensive analysis. There are no evident shortcuts or errors in the approach, and the results align with expected outcomes for this subtask.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Relationships Visualization,standard,pass,"Status: FAIL  
Reason: The provided code snippet is incomplete and truncated (""prin...""), preventing verification that the feature relationships visualization was fully implemented. Without the complete plotting code, it is unclear if the subtask objective of visualizing feature relationships was properly addressed. The execution output mentions scatter plots but does not confirm that the code generated them correctly or comprehensively. Therefore, the implementation cannot be confidently marked as passing.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Quality and Consistency Checks,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation correctly performs key data quality checks by identifying duplicate records and verifying numerical feature values against their summary statistics' min and max. The code logic aligns with the subtask objective of data quality and consistency checks during EDA, and the output reflects expected results without any evident issues or shortcuts.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
