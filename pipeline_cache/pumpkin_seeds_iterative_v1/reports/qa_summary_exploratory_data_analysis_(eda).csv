Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),iterative_4_step,pass,"Status: PASS

Reason:  
The iterative process was executed thoroughly and systematically across all four steps. The Planner (DrAliceSmith) provided clear, detailed instructions emphasizing a comprehensive EDA with strategic objectives and rationale. The Initial Developer (JohnDoe) implemented a broad and well-structured EDA covering descriptive statistics, visualizations, correlation analyses, and outlier detection, directly reflecting the Planner's guidance.

The Auditor (MariaGarcia) gave constructive and positive feedback, acknowledging the implementation's strengths while suggesting meaningful enhancements. These suggestions prompted the Final Developer (JohnDoe) to incorporate significant improvements such as quantitative class imbalance metrics (imbalance ratio, Gini coefficient), enhanced visualizations with annotations, and explicit missing data handlingâ€”addressing potential gaps and enriching the analysis.

The final implementation clearly aligns with the original task of thorough exploratory data analysis to inform downstream modeling. The execution results confirm that the final code ran successfully without errors, producing expected outputs.

Overall, the agents demonstrated effective coordination by building upon each other's contributions, and the auditor's feedback led to tangible quality improvements. The process completeness, quality enhancement, and successful execution collectively justify a PASS status.","['DrAliceSmith', 'JohnDoe', 'MariaGarcia', 'JohnDoe']",True,Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
