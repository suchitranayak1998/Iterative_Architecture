subtask,process_type,status,reason,phase
Handle missing values,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The code correctly checks for missing values in each column and prints the counts, which addresses the subtask objective of handling missing values. The logic is relevant and appropriate for identifying missing data before imputation. The output aligns with the expected outcome of showing missing value counts per column. There are no obvious issues or shortcuts in the provided snippet.",Feature Engineering
Encode categorical variables,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The code correctly identifies categorical columns, confirms the 'Class' column as categorical, and applies Label Encoding as intended. The output shows the unique categories and the encoded values, demonstrating that the subtask objective of encoding categorical variables is fully addressed without any apparent issues or shortcuts.",Feature Engineering
Create interaction features,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation clearly defines interaction feature pairs based on domain knowledge, creates new features using products and ratios, and provides summary statistics confirming their creation. The logic aligns with the subtask objective of creating interaction features, and no obvious issues or shortcuts are evident.",Feature Engineering
Generate polynomial features,standard,fail,"Status: FAIL  
Reason: The output shows polynomial features (squares and cubes) were generated for the intended numerical columns, which aligns with the subtask objective. However, the snippet includes a typo in the feature name ""Aspect_Ration"" instead of ""Aspect_Ratio,"" indicating a potential issue in column naming or selection. This could lead to incorrect or missing features. Without full code, it is unclear if the polynomial features were correctly appended to the dataset or if interaction terms were handled properly. The presence of ellipses and incomplete code also prevents full verification. Therefore, despite partial alignment, the implementation has an obvious issue that warrants failure.",Feature Engineering
Scale numerical features,standard,fail,"Status: FAIL  
Reason: The code snippet is incomplete and shows an ellipsis (""df...."") instead of actual logic to identify numerical columns and perform scaling. Without the full implementation of scaling numerical features using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler, it is unclear if the subtask objective is fully addressed. Additionally, the printed output is truncated and does not confirm that scaling was applied. Therefore, the subtask is not properly verified as implemented.",Feature Engineering
Feature selection,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation clearly addresses the feature selection subtask by computing and displaying top features based on correlation with the target and using model-based importance (RandomForestClassifier). The code imports relevant libraries, applies appropriate methods, and outputs meaningful feature rankings. The results shown align with expected outcomes for feature selection, and no obvious issues or shortcuts are evident.",Feature Engineering
Dimensionality reduction,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation correctly applies PCA for dimensionality reduction by standardizing features and reducing from 9 to 4 components. The explained variance ratios are provided, indicating meaningful variance capture. The code logic aligns with the subtask objective, and no obvious issues or shortcuts are present.",Feature Engineering
