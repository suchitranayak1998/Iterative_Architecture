Reason:  
The iterative process was executed thoroughly and systematically across all four steps. The planner (DrAliceJohnson) provided a comprehensive and clear strategic overview and detailed instructions focused on numerical feature assessment and transformation, setting a strong foundation.

The initial developer implementation (BobMartinez) addressed the core requirements by identifying numerical features, computing distribution metrics, detecting outliers, and visualizing distributions, demonstrating a solid initial solution aligned with the planner’s instructions.

The auditor (CarolLee) provided constructive and insightful feedback, recognizing the strengths of the initial implementation while identifying areas for enhancement, such as explicit missing data handling and more robust outlier treatment.

The final developer implementation effectively incorporated the auditor’s feedback by adding median imputation for missing values, implementing outlier capping at IQR bounds, enhancing outlier detection logging, and improving transformation steps. This shows excellent agent coordination and responsiveness to feedback, resulting in a more robust and complete solution.

Execution results confirm that the final code ran successfully, produced expected outputs (including logs and summaries), and handled all identified numerical features appropriately.

Overall, the process demonstrates strong collaboration, meaningful quality improvements driven by auditor feedback, and a final implementation that fully addresses the original task of numerical feature assessment and transformation. Therefore, the process merits a PASS.","['DrAliceJohnson', 'BobMartinez', 'CarolLee', 'BobMartinez']",True,Feature Engineering
