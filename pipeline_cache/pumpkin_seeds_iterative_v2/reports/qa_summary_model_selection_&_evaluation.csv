Reason:  
The iterative process for the Model Selection & Evaluation task was executed thoroughly and effectively across all four steps. The Planner (DrAliceSmith) provided a clear, detailed, and well-justified modeling strategy that aligned with best practices and project goals. The Initial Developer (JohnDoe) implemented this strategy with appropriate data splitting, model training, and evaluation steps, demonstrating a solid baseline implementation.

The Auditor (EmilyJohnson) conducted a comprehensive review, confirming alignment with the strategy and best practices while identifying areas for enhancement, such as inclusion of additional relevant features and artifact management improvements. This feedback was clearly constructive and actionable.

The Final Developer implementation incorporated the auditorâ€™s feedback meaningfully, refining the model pipeline by including additional features (log-transformed, outlier flags), ensuring proper data splits, and improving artifact handling. The final code executed successfully, indicating a robust and functional solution.

Agent coordination was effective, with each agent building upon the previous outputs and feedback, resulting in a clear quality improvement from initial plan through to final implementation. The process completeness is confirmed by the presence and quality of all four steps, and the final implementation fully addresses the original task requirements.

Overall, this iterative process demonstrates a high-quality, collaborative approach that improved the solution quality and met all evaluation criteria.","['DrAliceSmith', 'JohnDoe', 'EmilyJohnson', 'JohnDoe']",True,Model Selection & Evaluation
