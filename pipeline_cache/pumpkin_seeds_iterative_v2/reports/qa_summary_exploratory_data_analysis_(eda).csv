Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),iterative_4_step,pass,"Status: PASS

Reason:  
The iterative process for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) task was executed thoroughly and effectively across all four steps. Each agent fulfilled their role properly, demonstrating strong coordination and progressive refinement of the solution.

1. **Process Completeness:**  
All four steps—planning, initial implementation, auditing, and final implementation—were completed as required. The planner provided detailed, strategic instructions. The developer implemented a comprehensive EDA accordingly. The auditor reviewed the implementation with constructive feedback. The developer then enhanced the final implementation based on this feedback.

2. **Agent Coordination:**  
There was clear and effective collaboration among agents. The developer’s initial implementation closely followed the planner’s instructions. The auditor’s feedback was detailed and positive, highlighting strengths and suggesting meaningful improvements. The developer incorporated these suggestions, such as enabling plot saving and enhancing outlier handling, demonstrating responsiveness and iterative improvement.

3. **Quality Improvement:**  
The auditor’s feedback led to tangible enhancements in the final implementation. For example, enabling plot saving ensures reproducibility and easier review of visual outputs. Adding explicit outlier flag columns improves data quality assessment and downstream analysis. These changes reflect a meaningful elevation in the quality and usability of the EDA outputs.

4. **Final Implementation:**  
The final code comprehensively addresses the original task of performing exploratory data analysis. It includes descriptive statistics, visualizations, correlation and class balance analyses, and improved outlier handling. The outputs are well-organized and saved for review, aligning with the strategic objectives outlined in the planner’s instructions.

5. **Execution Success:**  
The final code executed successfully without errors, producing expected outputs such as data shape, missing data checks, descriptive statistics, and presumably the saved plots and outlier flags.

Overall, the iterative process demonstrates a high-quality, collaborative approach that improved the solution at each step, culminating in a robust and complete EDA implementation. Therefore, the process merits a PASS.","['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'Bob']",True,Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
