subtask,process_type,status,reason,phase
Data Overview and Summary Statistics,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The code correctly performs exploratory data analysis by displaying summary statistics for numerical columns using df.describe() and showing data types for all columns with df.dtypes. The output snippet confirms that summary statistics are generated as expected, indicating the subtask objective is fully addressed with appropriate and relevant logic and no evident issues.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Missing Values and Data Types Analysis,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The code correctly checks for missing values in each column using df.isnull().sum() and prints the results, fulfilling the missing values analysis. It also prints the data types of each column with df.dtypes, addressing the data types analysis. The output aligns with the expected format, and there are no evident issues or shortcuts in the implementation.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution Analysis of Numerical Features,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation correctly selects numerical features, computes and prints summary statistics, which aligns with the objective of distribution analysis in EDA. The code uses appropriate libraries and methods without shortcuts, and the output shows expected statistical summaries, indicating relevant logic and expected results.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Correlation Analysis,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation correctly selects numerical columns, computes the correlation matrix, and prints it, which aligns with the subtask objective of correlation analysis during EDA. The output shows a valid correlation matrix with expected values, and no obvious issues or shortcuts are present.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Class Distribution Analysis,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The code correctly calculates and prints both the counts and proportions of each class in the dataset, addressing the class distribution analysis objective. The output aligns with expected results, showing meaningful class counts and proportions. There are no obvious issues or shortcuts in the implementation.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Outlier Detection,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation correctly focuses on numerical columns and applies the IQR method for outlier detection, calculating Q1, Q3, IQR, and bounds, then counting potential outliers per feature. The output format is clear and consistent with expected EDA practices. There are no evident shortcuts or errors in logic.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Relationships Visualization,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation correctly identifies numerical features, computes their correlation matrix, selects strongly correlated features with an absolute correlation above 0.7, and generates a pair plot for these features. The output confirms the identification of relevant features and saving of the visualization, effectively addressing the subtask objective without evident issues or shortcuts.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Quality Checks,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation correctly identifies categorical columns and prints their unique values, checks for duplicate rows, and inspects the scale of numerical features by reporting min and max values. These steps are relevant and appropriate for data quality checks during EDA. The output aligns with expected results, and no obvious issues or shortcuts are present.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
