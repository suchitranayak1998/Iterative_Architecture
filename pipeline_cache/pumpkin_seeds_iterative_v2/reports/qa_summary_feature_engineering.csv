Reason:  
The iterative process for the Feature Engineering task was executed thoroughly and effectively across all four steps. The Planner (Alex) provided clear, comprehensive instructions emphasizing key feature engineering components such as handling missing values, outliers, skewness, feature creation, and validation. The Initial Developer (Jamie) implemented these instructions well, covering all critical aspects as confirmed by the Auditor (Taylor).

The Auditor’s feedback was constructive and acknowledged the alignment with the Planner’s goals while suggesting improvements, particularly around visualization saving and code consistency. Jamie’s Final Implementation incorporated these suggestions meaningfully—adding systematic saving of all relevant plots with descriptive filenames and ensuring consistent naming conventions—thereby enhancing auditability, reproducibility, and code quality.

Execution results confirm that the final code ran successfully without errors and produced expected outputs, including detailed correlation analyses and feature engineering steps. The agents demonstrated strong coordination, with each step building logically on the previous one, and the auditor’s input clearly driving quality improvements.

Overall, the process shows a well-managed, iterative refinement that improved the solution quality and met the original task objectives comprehensively.","['Alex', 'Jamie', 'Taylor', 'Jamie']",True,Feature Engineering
