subtask,process_type,status,reason,phase
Handle Missing Values,standard,fail,"Status: FAIL  
Reason: The code only checks for missing values and prints a message if none are found but does not implement any handling or imputation logic for missing values, which is the core objective of the subtask.",Feature Engineering
Encode Categorical Variable,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The code correctly uses LabelEncoder to encode the categorical 'Class' column, producing a new encoded column and printing the mapping. The output shows expected mappings and sample data, indicating the subtask objective is fully addressed without shortcuts or errors.",Feature Engineering
Feature Scaling,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation correctly identifies numerical features, calculates skewness, and applies an appropriate scaling method (standardization) based on the skewness values, which are all below 0.5 indicating near-normal distribution. The output clearly documents the analysis and transformation steps, showing relevant logic and alignment with expected feature scaling practices. No obvious issues or shortcuts are present.",Feature Engineering
Create Interaction Features,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation defines relevant features for interaction based on correlation and domain knowledge, creates new interaction features (e.g., ratios and products), and evaluates their correlation with the target variable. The output shows meaningful correlations for the newly created features, indicating the subtask objective of creating interaction features was met with appropriate logic and expected results. No obvious issues or shortcuts are evident.",Feature Engineering
Generate Polynomial Features,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation correctly identifies 12 base numerical features and applies polynomial feature generation using sklearn's PolynomialFeatures. The output indicates the original and resulting feature counts, demonstrating that polynomial features were successfully created. There are no evident shortcuts or errors, and the logic aligns well with the subtask objective of generating polynomial features for feature engineering.",Feature Engineering
Feature Selection,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation addresses the feature selection subtask by computing and reporting the top features based on absolute Pearson correlation with the target, which is a relevant and common approach in feature engineering. The code imports appropriate libraries and processes a large number of numeric features (489), indicating thoroughness. The output aligns with expected results, showing meaningful feature importance scores. No obvious issues or shortcuts are evident from the summary and output provided.",Feature Engineering
Dimensionality Reduction,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation correctly applies PCA for dimensionality reduction, selecting numeric features excluding the target, standardizing them, and retaining components that explain at least 95% variance. The dimensionality reduction from 489 to 3 components is consistent with the explained variance criterion, and the PCA components are properly added to the dataframe. No obvious issues or shortcuts are present.",Feature Engineering
Feature Transformation,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation correctly identifies features with low skewness and skips transformation, while applying Box-Cox transformation to features with higher skewness, aligning with the objective of reducing skewness through feature transformation. The logic is appropriate and the output matches expected behavior without evident shortcuts or issues.",Feature Engineering
Outlier Treatment,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation clearly identifies key numerical features for outlier treatment, applies the IQR method for outlier detection, and caps outliers accordingly. The output summary confirms that 17 features were processed with calculated bounds and counts of outliers, demonstrating relevant logic and alignment with the subtask objective of outlier treatment in feature engineering. No obvious issues or shortcuts are evident from the provided information.",Feature Engineering
Feature Aggregation,standard,fail,"Status: FAIL  
Reason: The provided code snippet is incomplete and truncated, preventing verification that the feature aggregation logic is correctly implemented. Without full code, it is unclear if the subtask objective is fully addressed or if the calculations are correct. Additionally, the output summary is partial and does not confirm the expected feature engineering results.",Feature Engineering
