<h1>Iterative Feature Engineering Report Summary</h1>

<h2>1. Strategic Insights</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Enhance dataset quality and model readiness by encoding the target variable, detecting outliers, analyzing feature correlations, creating new domain-relevant features, handling missing data, scaling features, and evaluating feature importance.</li>
  <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> High-quality features and clean data improve model accuracy and interpretability. Outlier detection reduces noise, feature selection mitigates multicollinearity, and scaling ensures uniformity for sensitive models.</li>
  <li><strong>Key Planning Decisions:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Explicit verification of target class labels before encoding.</li>
      <li>Use of Interquartile Range (IQR) method for outlier detection with boolean flags.</li>
      <li>Creation of ratio, polynomial (squared), and interaction features to capture domain relationships.</li>
      <li>Prior feature selection based on correlation threshold before scaling.</li>
      <li>Structured logging and modular code design for auditability and maintainability.</li>
      <li>Saving processed data and reports for downstream use and transparency.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Implementation Quality</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Code is modularized into well-defined functions for target encoding, outlier detection, safe division, VIF calculation, correlation plotting, and feature importance evaluation.</li>
  <li>Robust error handling with try-except blocks and detailed logging replaces print statements, improving production readiness.</li>
  <li>Division by zero in ratio features is handled gracefully by adding a small epsilon to denominators, avoiding bias introduced by zero-filling.</li>
  <li>Feature scaling is applied only to selected features with correlation magnitude &gt; 0.1 with the target, reducing noise and unnecessary computation.</li>
  <li>DataFrame is modified in-place with consistent, descriptive column naming conventions for original features, outlier flags, and new features.</li>
  <li>Output directories for visualizations and reports are created to organize artifacts systematically.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Audit Findings</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Strengths:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Comprehensive coverage of all planned steps aligned with strategic goals.</li>
      <li>Clear documentation and logging of each transformation and outcome.</li>
      <li>Visualizations (boxplots, correlation heatmaps) generated and saved for interpretability and audit.</li>
      <li>Outlier counts and feature importance scores are summarized and saved as CSV reports.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Areas for Improvement:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Explicit verification of target encoding mapping to handle unexpected or inconsistent class labels.</li>
      <li>Additional validation of outlier detection via alternative methods or visualizations (e.g., scatterplots) to confirm appropriateness.</li>
      <li>Use of feature importance scores or multicollinearity metrics (VIF) to guide feature selection beyond correlation thresholds.</li>
      <li>Further modularization of repeated logic and potential automation of report generation.</li>
      <li>Inclusion of structured logging or reporting for transformation summaries beyond console output.</li>
