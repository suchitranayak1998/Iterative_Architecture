Assess and encode the target variable by verifying class labels and creating a binary target column ('Class_binary') for modeling,standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation correctly assesses the target variable by verifying class labels and creates a new binary target column ('Class_binary') as required. The code logically encodes the target variable for modeling, aligns with the subtask objective, and shows no evident issues or shortcuts.",Feature Engineering
"Detect, flag, and document outliers across all numerical features using statistical methods (e.g., IQR) and create corresponding boolean outlier flags",standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation includes detection of outliers across numerical features using the IQR method, creates boolean flags for each feature indicating outlier presence, and documents these flags appropriately. The logic aligns with the subtask objective, and no shortcuts or issues are evident in the approach.",Feature Engineering
"Analyze feature correlations with the target ('Class_binary') and among features to identify highly predictive features and multicollinearity, informing feature selection or reduction",standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation includes encoding the target variable, computing correlations between features and the target ('Class_binary'), and calculating Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to detect multicollinearity among features. These steps directly address the subtask objective of analyzing feature correlations and multicollinearity to inform feature selection or reduction. The use of appropriate statistical methods (correlation analysis and VIF) and relevant libraries confirms that the code performs the necessary logic. There are no evident shortcuts or missing steps, and the output aligns with the expected outcome for this subtask.",Feature Engineering
"Generate new features or transformations that capture domain-relevant relationships or interactions (e.g., ratios like Perimeter/Area, or polynomial features) to enhance model performance",standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation includes generating new features that capture domain-relevant relationships, such as ratios or polynomial features, which aligns with the subtask objective. The code logically performs feature transformations and interactions to enhance model performance. The output and approach are consistent with expected outcomes for feature engineering, and no obvious issues or shortcuts are present.",Feature Engineering
"Handle missing data by confirming absence or applying appropriate imputation/removal strategies, ensuring data completeness for modeling",standard,fail,"Status: FAIL  
Reason: The provided summary and code snippet do not explicitly demonstrate any handling of missing dataâ€”no checks for missing values, no imputation strategies, nor removal of incomplete records are shown. Handling missing data is critical for data completeness before modeling, and its absence means the subtask objective is not met.",Feature Engineering
"Standardize or normalize numerical features as needed to ensure uniform scaling, especially if models are sensitive to feature magnitude",standard,fail,"Status: FAIL  
Reason: The provided summary and code snippet do not explicitly show any implementation of standardization or normalization of numerical features. Although StandardScaler is imported, there is no evidence that it or any other scaling method was applied to the dataset. Without actual scaling steps, the subtask objective of ensuring uniform feature scaling is not addressed.",Feature Engineering
"Evaluate feature importance through simple techniques (e.g., univariate tests, correlation coefficients) to prioritize features for the next modeling phase",standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation includes the use of univariate tests (ANOVA F-test via f_classif and SelectKBest) and correlation analysis to evaluate feature importance, which aligns well with the subtask objective. The code imports appropriate libraries and applies relevant logic to prioritize features for modeling. There are no evident shortcuts or issues, and the results are consistent with expected outcomes for feature importance evaluation.",Feature Engineering
"Document all transformations, feature selections, and reasoning to facilitate audit validation and iterative refinement",standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation comprehensively documents all key transformations including target encoding, outlier detection and flagging, feature relationship analysis, new feature creation, and data preparation steps. The code imports relevant libraries and applies appropriate methods such as scaling, feature selection, and multicollinearity checks, aligning well with the subtask objective. There are no evident shortcuts or missing steps, ensuring the process is transparent and audit-friendly.",Feature Engineering
