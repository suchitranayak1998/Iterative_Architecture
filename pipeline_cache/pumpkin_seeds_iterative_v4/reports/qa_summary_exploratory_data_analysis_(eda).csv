"Generate descriptive statistics and distribution plots for each numerical feature to understand their ranges, central tendencies, and variability",standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation explicitly generates descriptive statistics and distribution plots for each numerical feature, addressing ranges, central tendencies, and variability as required. It also flags and stores data quality issues such as missing data and outliers, enhancing the analysis depth. The code logic aligns well with the subtask objective, and the output summary confirms the DataFrame's structure and data quality insights without shortcuts or omissions.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize the distribution of the target variable 'Class' to assess class imbalance and distribution,standard,fail,"Status: FAIL  
Reason: The provided summary and code snippet focus on general EDA improvements such as flagging missing data and outliers, but there is no explicit mention or evidence of visualizing the distribution of the target variable 'Class'. Without a plot or visualization (e.g., bar chart, countplot) showing the class distribution, the subtask objective to assess class imbalance and distribution is not fulfilled.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
"Create pairwise scatter plots and correlation heatmaps for numerical features to identify relationships, multicollinearity, and potential feature interactions",standard,fail,"Status: FAIL  
Reason: The provided summary and code snippet focus on data quality flagging and general EDA improvements but do not explicitly mention or demonstrate the creation of pairwise scatter plots or correlation heatmaps for numerical features. Without evidence of generating these visualizations, the subtask objective to identify relationships, multicollinearity, and feature interactions via pairwise plots and heatmaps is not fulfilled.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
"Analyze feature distributions and relationships across different classes by plotting boxplots, violin plots, or grouped histograms for key features",standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation explicitly includes analysis of feature distributions and relationships across classes using appropriate visualizations such as boxplots, violin plots, and grouped histograms. It also incorporates data quality checks and flags outliers, which enhances the depth of the exploratory analysis. The code logic aligns well with the subtask objective, and the output indicates a thorough examination of the dataset structure and features. No obvious issues or shortcuts are evident.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
"Identify and handle outliers in numerical features through visualizations (boxplots) and statistical methods, documenting their potential impact",standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation explicitly identifies outliers in numerical features using both visualizations (boxplots) and statistical methods. It flags outliers by adding boolean columns to the DataFrame, stores data quality issues separately, and documents their potential impact as part of the EDA. The code logic aligns well with the subtask objective, and the output indicates thorough data quality assessment without shortcuts or omissions.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
"Investigate missing data patterns and assess the need for imputation or removal, even if missingness appears minimal",standard,pass,"Status: PASS  
Reason: The implementation explicitly investigates missing data patterns by reporting non-null counts per column and flags data quality issues including missingness. It stores these issues in dedicated structures and annotates the DataFrame accordingly, enabling assessment of whether imputation or removal is needed. The approach is thorough and aligns well with the subtask objective of investigating missing data patterns even if minimal, with no evident shortcuts or omissions.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
"Perform initial feature importance analysis using simple techniques (e.g., correlation or univariate tests) to prioritize features for modeling",standard,fail,"Status: FAIL  
Reason: The provided implementation summary and code snippet focus extensively on comprehensive EDA, data quality flagging, and outlier marking, but there is no explicit evidence that initial feature importance analysis using simple techniques (such as correlation or univariate tests) was performed. The subtask specifically requires prioritizing features based on their relationship to the target variable, which is not demonstrated or mentioned in the output or code summary. Therefore, the subtask objective is not fully addressed.",Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
