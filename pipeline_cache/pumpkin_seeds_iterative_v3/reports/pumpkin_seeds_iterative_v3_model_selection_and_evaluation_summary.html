<h1>Iterative Data Science Report Summary: Model Selection & Evaluation</h1>

<h2>1. Strategic Insights</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Model Choice:</strong> RandomForestClassifier selected for its robustness to feature scaling, outliers, and ability to handle high-dimensional, multiclass, and imbalanced data.</li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation Metrics:</strong> Focus on F1-score (macro and weighted), accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices to comprehensively assess model performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Splitting:</strong> Stratified train/validation/test split (70/10/20) to preserve class distributions and ensure reliable evaluation.</li>
  <li><strong>Hyperparameter Tuning:</strong> GridSearchCV with stratified 5-fold cross-validation targeting weighted F1-score to optimize model parameters.</li>
  <li><strong>Success Criteria:</strong> Achieve stable and reproducible model performance meeting or exceeding F1-score threshold (≥ 0.75) without overfitting.</li>
  <li><strong>Reproducibility & Auditability:</strong> Fixed random seed (42), saved split indices, and modular pipeline design to facilitate transparency and iterative improvements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Implementation Quality</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Modular, function-based Python code implementing the full modeling pipeline: data splitting, training, tuning, evaluation, plotting, artifact saving, and reporting.</li>
  <li>Robust logging and exception handling included to ensure traceability and error transparency.</li>
  <li>Reproducibility ensured via fixed random seeds and saved split indices.</li>
  <li>Efficient use of parallelism (<code>n_jobs=-1</code>) for training and tuning to optimize runtime.</li>
  <li>Comprehensive evaluation with detailed metrics and visualizations (confusion matrices, feature importance).</li>
  <li>Final retraining on combined train+validation data to maximize training data usage.</li>

  <li>All artifacts (models, parameters, metrics, plots, logs) saved in structured directories for audit and reproducibility.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Process Effectiveness</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The iterative 4-step workflow (Planner → Developer → Auditor → Developer) effectively ensured alignment between strategy and implementation.</li>
  <li>Audit feedback led to meaningful refinements: enhanced logging, cross-validation summaries, normalized confusion matrices, and improved reporting.</li>
