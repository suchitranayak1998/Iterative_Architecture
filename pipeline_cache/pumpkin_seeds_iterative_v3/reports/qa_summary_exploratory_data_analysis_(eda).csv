Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),iterative_4_step,pass,"Status: PASS

Reason:  
The iterative process for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) task was executed thoroughly and effectively across all four steps. The planner (Alice) provided a clear, detailed strategic overview and comprehensive instructions that set a solid foundation. The initial developer implementation (Bob) closely followed these instructions, delivering a well-structured EDA covering descriptive statistics, visualizations, missing value and outlier detection, and preliminary feature engineering.

The auditor (Carol) provided constructive, specific feedback that acknowledged the strengths of the initial implementation while identifying opportunities for improvement, such as better DataFrame handling, clearer documentation, and enhanced feature engineering steps. The final developer implementation (Bob) incorporated this feedback meaningfully, improving data handling by copying the original DataFrame, clarifying column renaming persistence, adding outlier flags and encoded features, and ensuring all changes were well documented.

The final code executed successfully without errors, producing expected outputs such as descriptive statistics saved to CSV and comprehensive visualizations. This demonstrates that the iterative feedback loop led to tangible quality improvements in both code robustness and analytical completeness.

Overall, the agents coordinated effectively, building upon each other's contributions to enhance the solution. The process completeness, quality improvement through auditing, and successful execution confirm that the iterative process met the QA evaluation criteria and improved the solution quality, warranting a PASS status.","['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'Bob']",True,Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
