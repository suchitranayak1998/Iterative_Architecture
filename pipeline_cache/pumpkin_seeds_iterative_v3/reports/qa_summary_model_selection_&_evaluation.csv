Reason:  
The iterative process for the Model Selection & Evaluation task was executed thoroughly and effectively across all four steps. Each agent contributed appropriately and built upon the previous outputs, demonstrating strong coordination and collaboration.

1. **Process Completeness:**  
All four steps were completed as required. The Planner (Alice) provided a detailed, clear, and modular plan outlining the modeling strategy and rationale. The Initial Developer (Bob) implemented the plan with appropriate data splitting, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics. The Auditor (Carol) gave comprehensive, actionable feedback identifying areas for improvement, such as code robustness, metric reporting, and reproducibility. Finally, the Developer (Bob) incorporated this feedback into a refined final implementation.

2. **Agent Coordination:**  
The agents showed effective handoffs and iterative refinement. Bob’s initial implementation closely followed Alice’s plan. Carol’s audit was detailed and constructive, focusing on enhancing code quality, evaluation rigor, and documentation. Bob’s final implementation addressed these points, indicating good responsiveness and collaboration.

3. **Quality Improvement:**  
The auditor’s feedback led to meaningful improvements. The final code included better logging, clearer metric reporting, reproducible train/val/test splits, and improved modularity. These enhancements increased the solution’s robustness, auditability, and maintainability, aligning well with the original planning goals.

4. **Final Implementation:**  
The final code fully addressed the original task of model selection and evaluation using RandomForestClassifier. It implemented stratified splits, hyperparameter tuning, training, evaluation on validation and test sets, and comprehensive reporting. The inclusion of visualization and logging further strengthened the deliverable.

5. **Execution Success:**  
The final code executed successfully without errors, confirming the practical viability of the solution.

Overall, the iterative process demonstrated a high-quality workflow with clear improvements driven by auditor feedback, culminating in a robust and complete solution. Therefore, the status is PASS.","['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'Bob']",True,Model Selection & Evaluation
